While one was on a lookout for an idea, the other wanted a book subscription box that catered to her bookish whims without costing a bomb â€” that is precisely how The BiblioBox happened! We are a Bangalore-based book subscription box, fulfilling your monthly bookish needs with thoughtfully-curated monthly and customized boxes, bringing to you all things books! While the trend of subscription boxes is taking the world by a storm, it is slowly, yet surely, making its way to the Indian Subcontinent.

While most boxes around the world cater to a specific genre or an age group, we, at The BiblioBox, aim to satisfy every palette. Whether you dig classics, or crime, or fantasy, or young adult fiction, we have something for each of you.

Apart from just sending two books, instead of the usual practice of one book per box, we also have a huge array of bookish merchandise that is either specifically designed by an artist, or done in-house. Bringing book-nerd delights to bibliophiles in the land of diversity with diverse themes each month, apart from customized boxes tailored as per your needs, we are here to satiate all your bookish cravings!

Go, indulge!
